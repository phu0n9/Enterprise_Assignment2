This is a set of API of an Ecommerce B2B websites like Alibaba or B2C websites like Tiki
  
## API Features
All the APIs share 4 main activities:

Moreover, there are some more APIs that support some following functions:

* **Inventory** of all products can be determined with numbers

* Open the **IntelliJ** and right click to the package Assignment 2 and chose **Terminal**.
* Type **```mvn jetty:run```** in the terminal

## Known bugs

All the bugs are handled successfully.

The order for running the test functions are:

* **CategoryControllerTest**
* **CustomerControllerTest**
* **StaffControllerTest**
* **ProductControllerTest**
* **ProviderControllerTest**
* **DeliveryControllerTest**
* **ReceivingNoteControllerTest**
* **SaleInvoiceControllerTest**

**```Attention:```** Should run delete method after other methods have been tested due to the test data in the Json files that I have inserted, so it would notify error because there are some mismatch between the inserted data and the test data
